  def Mutate(self, request, context):
    """Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports atomic
    transactions with multiple types of resources. For example, you can
    atomically create a campaign and a campaign budget, or perform up to
    thousands of mutates atomically.

    This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The
    only features it offers over calling those methods directly are:

    - Atomic transactions
    - Temp resource names (described below)
    - Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls

    Note: Only resources that support atomic transactions are included, so this
    method can't replace all calls to individual services.

    ## Atomic Transaction Benefits

    Atomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a series of
    changes and one fails, it can leave your account in an inconsistent state.
    With atomicity, you either reach the desired state directly, or the request
    fails and you can retry.

    ## Temp Resource Names

    Temp resource names are a special type of resource name used to create a
    resource and reference that resource in the same request. For example, if a
    campaign budget is created with `resource_name` equal to
    `customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1`, that resource name can be reused in
    the `Campaign.budget` field in the same request. That way, the two
    resources are created and linked atomically.

    To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the
    name that the server would normally allocate.

    Note:

    - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused.
    For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if
    the mutate order was reversed.
    - Temp names are not remembered across requests.
    - There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.
    - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource
    types differ.

    ## Latency

    It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time
    out and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual
    mutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For
    example, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while
    mutating 1 campaign, 1 ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls.
