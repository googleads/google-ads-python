        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the campaign feed. Campaign
            feed resource names have the form:

            belongs.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_feed``.

            Matching function associated with the
            CampaignFeed. The matching function is used to
            filter the set of feed items selected. Required.
        status (google.ads.googleads.v13.enums.types.FeedLinkStatusEnum.FeedLinkStatus):
