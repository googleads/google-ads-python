"""Removes the entire sitelink campaign extension setting.

Removes both the sitelink campaign extension setting itself and its associated
sitelink extension feed items. This requires two steps, since removing the
campaign extension setting doesn't automatically remove its extension feed
items.

To make this example work with other types of extensions, replace
ExtensionType.SITELINK with the extension type you wish to remove.
