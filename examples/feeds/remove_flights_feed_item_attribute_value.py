"""Removes a feed item attribute value of a feed item in a flights feed.

To create a flights feed, run the remarketing/add_flights_feed.py example. This
example is specific to feeds of type DYNAMIC_FLIGHT. The attribute you are
removing must be present on the feed.

This example is specifically for removing an attribute of a flights feed item,
but it can also be changed to work with other feed types.

To make this work with other feed types, replace the FlightPlaceholderField enum
with the equivalent one of your feed type, and replace the appropriate attribute
names in the _get_feeds method.
