        orders (float):
            Orders is the total number of purchase
            conversions you received attributed to your ads.
            How it works: You report conversions with cart
            data for completed purchases on your website. If
            a conversion is attributed to previous
            interactions with your ads (clicks for text or
            Shopping ads, views for video ads etc.) it's
            counted as an order. Example: Someone clicked on
            a Shopping ad for a hat then bought the same hat
            and a shirt in an order on your website. Even
            though they bought 2 products, this would count
            as 1 order.
            This metric is only available if you report
            conversions with cart data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_orders``.
        average_order_value_micros (int):
            Average order value is the average revenue
            you made per order attributed to your ads.
            How it works: You report conversions with cart
            data for completed purchases on your website.
            Average order value is the total revenue from
            your orders divided by the total number of
            orders.
            Example: You received 3 orders which made $10,
            $15 and $20 worth of revenue. The average order
            value is $15 = ($10 + $15 + $20)/3. This metric
            is only available if you report conversions with
            cart data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_average_order_value_micros``.
        average_cart_size (float):
            Average cart size is the average number of
            products in each order attributed to your ads.
            How it works: You report conversions with cart
            data for completed purchases on your website.
            Average cart size is the total number of
            products sold divided by the total number of
            orders you received. Example: You received 2
            orders, the first included 3 products and the
            second included 2. The average cart size is 2.5
            products = (3+2)/2. This metric is only
            available if you report conversions with cart
            data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_average_cart_size``.
        cost_of_goods_sold_micros (int):
            Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the total cost
            of the products you sold in orders attributed to
            your ads. How it works: You can add a cost of
            goods sold value to every product in Merchant
            Center. If you report conversions with cart
            data, the products you sold are matched with
            their cost of goods sold value and this can be
            used to calculate the gross profit you made on
            each order. Example: Someone clicked on a
            Shopping ad for a hat then bought the same hat
            and a shirt. The hat has a cost of goods sold
            value of $3, the shirt has a cost of goods sold
            value of $5. The cost of goods sold for this
            order is $8 = $3 + $5.
            This metric is only available if you report
            conversions with cart data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_cost_of_goods_sold_micros``.
        gross_profit_micros (int):
            Gross profit is the profit you made from
            orders attributed to your ads minus the cost of
            goods sold (COGS). How it works: Gross profit is
            the revenue you made from sales attributed to
            your ads minus cost of goods sold. Gross profit
            calculations only include products that have a
            cost of goods sold value in Merchant Center.
            Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a
            hat then bought the same hat and a shirt in an
            order from your website. The hat is priced $10
            and the shirt is priced $20. The hat has a cost
            of goods sold value of $3, but the shirt has no
            cost of goods sold value. Gross profit for this
            order will only take into account the hat, so
            it's $7 = $10 - $3. This metric is only
            available if you report conversions with cart
            data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_gross_profit_micros``.
        gross_profit_margin (float):
            Gross profit margin is the percentage gross
            profit you made from orders attributed to your
            ads, after taking out the cost of goods sold
            (COGS). How it works: You report conversions
            with cart data for completed purchases on your
            website. Gross profit margin is the gross profit
            you made divided by your total revenue and
            multiplied by 100%. Gross profit margin
            calculations only include products that have a
            cost of goods sold value in Merchant Center.
            Example: Someone bought a hat and a shirt in an
            order on your website. The hat is priced $10 and
            has a cost of goods sold value of $3. The shirt
            is priced $20 but has no cost of goods sold
            value. Gross profit margin for this order will
            only take into account the hat because it has a
            cost of goods sold value, so it's 70% = ($10 -
            $3)/$10 x 100%. This metric is only available if
            you report conversions with cart data.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_gross_profit_margin``.
        revenue_micros (int):
            Revenue is the total amount you made from
            orders attributed to your ads. How it works: You
            report conversions with cart data for completed
            purchases on your website. Revenue is the total
            value of all the orders you received attributed
            to your ads, minus any discount.
            Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad  for a
            hat then bought the same hat and a shirt in an
            order from your website. The hat is priced $10
            and the shirt is priced $20. The entire order
            has a $5 discount. The revenue from this order
            is $25 = ($10 + $20) - $5.
            This metric is only available if you report
            conversions with cart data.

            How it works: You report conversions with cart
            data for completed purchases on your website.
            Units sold is the total number of products sold
            from all orders attributed to your ads.
            Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a
            hat then bought the same hat, a shirt and a
            jacket. The units sold in this order is 3. This
            metric is only available if you report
            conversions with cart data.

        cross_sell_cost_of_goods_sold_micros (int):
            Cross-sell cost of goods sold (COGS) is the
            total cost of products sold as a result of
            advertising a different product. How it works:
            You report conversions with cart data for
            completed purchases on your website. If the ad
            that was interacted with before the purchase has
            an associated product (see Shopping Ads) then
            this product is considered the advertised
            product. Any product included in the order the
            customer places is a sold product. If these
            products don't match then this is considered
            cross-sell. Cross-sell cost of goods sold is the
            total cost of the products sold that weren't
            advertised.
            Example: Someone clicked on a Shopping ad for a
            hat then bought the same hat and a shirt. The
            hat has a cost of goods sold value of $3, the
            shirt has a cost of goods sold value of $5. The
            cross-sell cost of goods sold for this order is
            $5.
            This metric is only available if you report
            conversions with cart data.

            Any product included in the purchase is a sold
            product. If these products don't match then this

            profit is the revenue you made from cross-sell

            and a shirt. The shirt is priced $20 and has a
            cost of goods sold value of $5. The cross-sell
