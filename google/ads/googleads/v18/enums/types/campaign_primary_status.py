                Not specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):

            REMOVED (4):
                The user-specified campaign status is
                removed.
            ENDED (5):
                The user-specified time for this campaign to
                end has passed.
            PENDING (6):
                The campaign may serve in the future.
            MISCONFIGURED (7):
                The campaign or its associated entities have
                incorrect user-specified settings.
            LIMITED (8):

                limited by user-specified settings.
            LEARNING (9):

            NOT_ELIGIBLE (10):
