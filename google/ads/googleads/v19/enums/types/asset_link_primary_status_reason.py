    class AssetLinkPrimaryStatusReason(proto.Enum):
        r"""Enum Provides insight into why an asset is not serving or not
        serving at full capacity for a particular link level. These
        reasons are aggregated to determine a final PrimaryStatus.
        For example, a sitelink might be paused by the user, but also
        limited in serving due to violation of an alcohol policy. In
        this case, the PrimaryStatus will be returned as PAUSED, since
        the asset's effective status is determined by its paused state.

        Values:
            UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Not specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value
                unknown in this version.
            ASSET_LINK_PAUSED (2):
                The asset is paused for its linked rollup
                level. Contributes to a PrimaryStatus of PAUSED.
            ASSET_LINK_REMOVED (3):
                The asset is removed for its linked rollup
                level. Contributes to a PrimaryStatus of
                REMOVED.
            ASSET_DISAPPROVED (4):
                The asset has been marked as disapproved. Contributes to a
                PrimaryStatus of NOT_ELIGIBLE
            ASSET_UNDER_REVIEW (5):
                The asset has not completed policy review.
                Contributes to a PrimaryStatus of PENDING.
            ASSET_APPROVED_LABELED (6):
                The asset is approved with policies applied.
                Contributes to a PrimaryStatus of LIMITED.
