"""This example generates budget recommendations on-the-fly for Performance Max campaigns.

Use this example to get budget recommendations during campaign creation workflows.

This example uses the following:
1) Performance Max for the campaign type
2) United States for the geo targeting
3) Maximize Conversion Value for the bidding strategy

To get impact metrics for a custom budget, run get_recommendation_impact_metrics.py.
