"""This example shows how to create a Performance Max for travel goals campaign.

It also uses TravelAssetSuggestionService to fetch suggested assets for creating
an asset group. In case there are not enough assets for the asset group
(required by Performance Max), this example will create more assets to fulfill
the requirements.

For more information about Performance Max campaigns, see
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/performance-max/overview.

Prerequisites:
- You must have at least one conversion action in the account. For more about
  conversion actions, see
  https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/overview#conversion_actions.

Notes:
- This example uses the default customer conversion goals. For an example of
  setting campaign-specific conversion goals, see
  shopping_ads/add_performance_max_retail_campaign.py.
- To learn how to create asset group signals, see
  advanced_operations/add_performance_max_campaign.py.
