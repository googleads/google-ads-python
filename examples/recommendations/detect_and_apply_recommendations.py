"""This example shows how to retrieve recommendations and apply them in a batch.

Recommendations should be applied shortly after they're retrieved. Depending on
the recommendation type, a recommendation can become obsolete quickly, and
obsolete recommendations throw an error when applied. For more details, see:
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/recommendations#take_action

As of Google Ads API v15 users can subscribe to certain recommendation types to
apply them automatically. For more details, see:
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/recommendations#auto-apply

As of Google Ads API v16 users can proactively generate certain recommendation
types during the campaign construction process. For more details see:
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/recommendations#recommendations-in-campaign-construction
