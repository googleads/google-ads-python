                Ad serving is optimized based on CTR \* Conversion for the

                bidding strategy, it will default to OPTIMIZED.
            ROTATE (4):
                Ads are rotated evenly for 90 days, then
                optimized for clicks.

                Show lower performing ads more evenly with
                higher performing ads, and do not optimize.
