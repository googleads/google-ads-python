"""This example shows how to create a Performance Max retail campaign.

This will be created for "All products".

For more information about Performance Max retail campaigns, see
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/performance-max/retail

Prerequisites:
- You need to have access to a Merchant Center account. You can find
  instructions to create a Merchant Center account here:
  https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188924.
  This account must be linked to your Google Ads account. The integration
  instructions can be found at:
  https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/shopping-ads/merchant-center
- You need your Google Ads account to track conversions. The different ways
  to track conversions can be found here:
  https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722054.
- You must have at least one conversion action in the account. For
  more about conversion actions, see
  https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/overview#conversion_actions
