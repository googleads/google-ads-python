"""This example illustrates how to cache page tokens in paged search requests.

GoogleAdsService.Search results are paginated but they can only be retrieved in
sequence starting with the first page. More details at:
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/paging.

This example searches campaigns illustrating how GoogleAdsService.Search result
page tokens can be cached and reused to retrieve previous pages. This is useful
when you need to request pages that were already requested in the past without
starting over from the first page. For example, it can be used to implement an
interactive application that displays a page of results at a time without
caching all the results first.

To add campaigns, run the basic_examples/add_campaigns.py example.
