class _CreateEnumTypeUponFirstAccess(object):
    r"""A lazy container class for a single capitalized Enum attribute.
    It will exec code to define the Enum type within the instance dict upon
    first access.  Reducing import time for a module full of Enum definitions.
    Example:
    >>> class ThingHolder(_CreateEnumTypeUponFirstAccess):
    ...   Thing = '''\
    ... Thing = '''\
class Thing(enum.IntEnum):
    ...     GOOD = 0
    ...     BAD = 1
    ...     UNKNOWN = 2
    ... '''
    ...
    >>> ThingHolder = ThingHolder()  # The instance enables the magic.
    This avoids executing the slow Python enum.Enum metaclass construction code
    at import time.  Instead, the first time ThingHolder.Thing is accessed, the
    code to define the enum type will be run and replace the Thing attribute on
    ThingHolder with the instantiated Thing type.
    >>> ThingHolder
    <ThingHolder object at 0x...>
    >>> dir(ThingHolder)
    ['Thing']
    >>> ThingHolder.Thing.UNKNOWN  # Triggers the actual creation of Thing.
    <Thing.UNKNOWN: 2>
    >>> ThingHolder.Thing.GOOD
    <Thing.GOOD: 0>
    >>> ThingHolder
    <class 'ThingHolder'>
    The import time enum type creation cost is deferred.  The runtime cost upon
    first access will be a bit higher.  Under the assumption that most
    applications never access the majority of the enum types, the reduction in
    startup time makes for a nicer experience.
