"""Shows how to write data from a basic campaign stats report to a CSV file.

This is important for migration because reports from the AdWords API are
returned in CSV format, so clients that are migrating may want to temporarily
convert Google Ads API reports to CSV while migrating their applications.

Examples:
    Write to file output.csv in the same directory as script with headers.
        $ python get_campaign_stats_to_csv.py -c 0123456789 -o output.csv -w

    Write to file output.csv in the same directory as script without headers.
        $ python get_campaign_stats_to_csv.py -c 0123456789 -o output.csv
