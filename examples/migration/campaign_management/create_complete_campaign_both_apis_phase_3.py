"""This example creates a search campaign with the AdWords and Google Ads APIs.

This code example is the fourth in a series of code examples that shows how to
create a Search campaign using the AdWords API, and then migrate it to the
Google Ads API one functionality at a time. See other examples in this directory
for code examples in various stages of migration.

In this code example, the functionality to create campaign budget and search
campaign have been migrated to the Google Ads API. The rest of the functionality
- creating ad groups, keywords and expanded text ads are done using the AdWords
API.
