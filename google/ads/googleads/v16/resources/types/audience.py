    r"""Audience is an effective targeting option that lets you
    intersect different segment attributes, such as detailed
    demographics and affinities, to create audiences that represent
    sections of your target segments.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the audience. Audience names
            have the form:

            ``customers/{customer_id}/audiences/{audience_id}``
        id (int):
            Output only. ID of the audience.
        status (google.ads.googleads.v16.enums.types.AudienceStatusEnum.AudienceStatus):
            Output only. Status of this audience.
            Indicates whether the audience is enabled or
            removed.
        name (str):
            Name of the audience. It should be unique across all
            audiences within the account. It must have a minimum length
            of 1 and maximum length of 255. Required when scope is not
            set or is set to CUSTOMER. Cannot be set or updated when
            scope is ASSET_GROUP.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        description (str):
            Description of this audience.
        dimensions (MutableSequence[google.ads.googleads.v16.common.types.AudienceDimension]):
            Positive dimensions specifying the audience
            composition.
        exclusion_dimension (google.ads.googleads.v16.common.types.AudienceExclusionDimension):
            Negative dimension specifying the audience
            composition.
        scope (google.ads.googleads.v16.enums.types.AudienceScopeEnum.AudienceScope):
            Defines the scope this audience can be used in. By default,
            the scope is CUSTOMER. Audiences can be created with a scope
            of ASSET_GROUP for exclusive use by a single asset_group.
            Scope may change from ASSET_GROUP to CUSTOMER but not from
            CUSTOMER to ASSET_GROUP.
        asset_group (str):
            Immutable. The asset group that this audience is scoped
            under. Must be set if and only if scope is ASSET_GROUP.
            Immutable after creation. If an audience with ASSET_GROUP
            scope is upgraded to CUSTOMER scope, this field will
            automatically be cleared.
