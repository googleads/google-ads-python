"""This example will create an OAuth2 refresh token for the Google Ads API.

This example works with both web and desktop app OAuth client ID types.

https://console.cloud.google.com

IMPORTANT: For web app clients types, you must add "http://127.0.0.1" to the
"Authorized redirect URIs" list in your Google Cloud Console project before
running this example. Desktop app client types do not require the local
redirect to be explicitly configured in the console.

Once complete, download the credentials and save the file path so it can be
passed into this example.

This example is a very simple implementation, for a more detailed example see:
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#python
