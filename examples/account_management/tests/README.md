# Tests for Account Management Examples

This directory contains unit tests for the Python scripts in the `examples/account_management` directory. These scripts demonstrate various account management functionalities of the Google Ads API.

## Coverage

The tests aim to cover the main logic of each example script, including:
- Correct parsing of command-line arguments (implicitly, as `main` functions are called directly).
- Proper interaction with mocked Google Ads API services.
- Verification of arguments passed to service methods.
- Validation of how API responses are processed.
- Confirmation of console output generated by the scripts.

Scripts tested:
- `create_customer.py`
- `get_account_hierarchy.py`
- `get_change_details.py`
- `get_change_summary.py`
- `invite_user_with_access_role.py`
- `link_manager_to_client.py`
- `list_accessible_customers.py`
- `update_user_access.py`
- `verify_advertiser_identity.py`

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `google-ads` Python library installed (version 19.0.0 or compatible, though the tests mock interactions so exact library version for running tests might be flexible as long as imports work). Refer to the main `requirements.txt` in the repository root.
- `unittest` module (standard library).

## Running the Tests

All tests in this directory can be run using the provided `run_tests.py` script.

1.  Navigate to the `examples/account_management/tests` directory from the root of this repository:
    ```bash
    cd examples/account_management/tests
    ```

2.  Ensure the `run_tests.py` script is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run_tests.py
    ```

3.  Execute the test runner script:
    ```bash
    ./run_tests.py
    ```

The script will discover and run all test cases (files named `test_*.py`) and report the results. It will exit with a status code of 0 for success and 1 if there are any failures.

## Important Note

These are **unit tests** that utilize extensive **mocking** of the Google Ads API client and its services. They **do not make any actual API calls** to Google Ads. All API interactions are simulated to test the logic of the example scripts in isolation. This ensures that tests can be run quickly, reliably, and without requiring live API credentials or affecting any actual Google Ads accounts.
