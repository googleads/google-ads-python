        could be one status with multiple reasons. For example, a
        sitelink might be paused by the user, but also limited in
        serving due to violation of an alcohol policy. In this case, the
        PrimaryStatus will be returned as PAUSED, since the asset's
        effective status is determined by its paused state.

                Used for return value only. Represents value
                unknown in this version.

                paused.

                The user-specified asset link status is

                The asset may serve in the future.

                The asset is serving in a partial capacity.
