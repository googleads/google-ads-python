"""Creates a smart shopping campaign, ad group, ad, and listing group.

These will be created for "All products".

Prerequisites:

  instructions to create a Merchant Center account here:
  https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188924.
  This account must be linked to your Google Ads account. The integration
  instructions can be found at:
  https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/shopping-ads/merchant-center
- You need your Google Ads account to track conversions. The different ways
