            UNSPECIFIED (0):
                The status has not been specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value
                unknown in this version.
            PROPOSED (2):
                Initial state of the draft, the advertiser
                can start adding changes with no effect on
                serving.
            REMOVED (3):
                The campaign draft is removed.
            PROMOTING (5):
                Advertiser requested to promote draft's
                changes back into the original campaign.
                Advertiser can poll the long running operation
                returned by the promote action to see the status
                of the promotion.
            PROMOTED (4):
                The process to merge changes in the draft
                back to the original campaign has completed
                successfully.
            PROMOTE_FAILED (6):
                The promotion failed after it was partially
                applied. Promote cannot be attempted again
                safely, so the issue must be corrected in the
                original campaign.
