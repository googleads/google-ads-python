"""Creates operations to add members to a user list (a.k.a. audience).

The example uses an OfflineUserDataJob, and if requested, runs the job. If a
job ID is specified, the example adds operations to that job. Otherwise, it
creates a new job for the operations.

IMPORTANT: Your application should create a single job containing all of the
operations for a user list. This will be far more efficient than creating and
running multiple jobs that each contain a small set of operations.

This feature is only available to accounts that meet the requirements described
at: https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717.
