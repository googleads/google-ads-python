class ShoppingProduct(proto.Message):
    r"""A shopping product from Google Merchant Center that can be
    advertised by campaigns.

    The resource returns currently existing products from Google
    Merchant Center accounts linked with the customer. A campaign
    includes a product by specifying its merchant id (or, if available,
    the Multi Client Account id of the merchant) in the
    ``ShoppingSetting``, and can limit the inclusion to products having
    a specified feed label. Standard Shopping campaigns can also limit
    the inclusion through a ``campaign_criterion.listing_scope``.

    Queries to this resource specify a scope: Account:

    -  Filters on campaigns or ad groups are not specified.
    -  All products from the linked Google Merchant Center accounts are
       returned.
    -  Metrics and some fields (see the per-field documentation) are
       aggregated across all Shopping and Performance Max campaigns that
       include a product. Campaign:
    -  An equality filter on ``campaign`` is specified. Supported
       campaign types are Shopping, Performance Max, Demand Gen, Video.
    -  Only products that are included by the specified campaign are
       returned.
    -  Metrics and some fields (see the per-field documentation) are
       restricted to the specified campaign. Ad group:
    -  An equality filter on ``ad group`` and ``campaign`` is specified.
       Supported campaign types are Shopping, Demand Gen, Video.
    -  Only products that are included by the specified campaign are
       returned.
    -  Metrics and some fields (see the per-field documentation) are
       restricted to the specified ad group. Note that segmentation by
       date segments is not permitted and will return
       UNSUPPORTED_DATE_SEGMENTATION error. On the other hand, filtering
       on date segments is allowed.
