        Values:
            UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Not specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value
                unknown in this version.
            UNIFORM (2):
                The values in a simulation were applied to
                all children of a given resource uniformly.
                Overrides on child resources were not respected.
            DEFAULT (3):
                The values in a simulation were applied to
                the given resource. Overrides on child resources
                were respected, and traffic estimates do not
                include these resources.
            SCALING (4):
                The values in a simulation were all scaled by
                the same factor. For example, in a simulated
                TargetCpa campaign, the campaign target and all
                ad group targets were scaled by a factor of X.
