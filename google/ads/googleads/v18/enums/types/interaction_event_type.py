        Values:
            UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Not specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value
                unknown in this version.
            CLICK (2):
                Click to site. In most cases, this
                interaction navigates to an external location,
                usually the advertiser's landing page. This is
                also the default InteractionEventType for click
                events.
            ENGAGEMENT (3):
                The user's expressed intent to engage with
                the ad in-place.
            VIDEO_VIEW (4):
                User viewed a video ad.
            NONE (5):
                The default InteractionEventType for ad
                conversion events. This is used when an ad
                conversion row does NOT indicate that the free
                interactions (for example, the ad conversions)
                should be 'promoted' and reported as part of the
                core metrics. These are simply other (ad)
                conversions.
