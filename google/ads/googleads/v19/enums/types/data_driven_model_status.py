            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value

            AVAILABLE (2):
                The data driven model is available.
            STALE (3):
                The data driven model is stale. It hasn't
                been updated for at least 7 days. It is still
                being used, but will become expired if it does
                not get updated for 30 days.
            EXPIRED (4):
                The data driven model expired. It hasn't been
                updated for at least 30 days and cannot be used.
                Most commonly this is because there hasn't been
                the required number of events in a recent 30-day
                period.
            NEVER_GENERATED (5):
                The data driven model has never been
                generated. Most commonly this is because there
                has never been the required number of events in
                any 30-day period.
