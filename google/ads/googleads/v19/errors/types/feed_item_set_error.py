        Values:
            UNSPECIFIED (0):
                Enum unspecified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                The received error code is not known in this
                version.
            FEED_ITEM_SET_REMOVED (2):
                The given ID refers to a removed FeedItemSet.
            CANNOT_CLEAR_DYNAMIC_FILTER (3):
                The dynamic filter of a feed item set cannot
                be cleared on UPDATE if it exists. A set is
                either static or dynamic once added, and that
                cannot change.
            CANNOT_CREATE_DYNAMIC_FILTER (4):
                The dynamic filter of a feed item set cannot
                be created on UPDATE if it does not exist. A set
                is either static or dynamic once added, and that
                cannot change.
            INVALID_FEED_TYPE (5):
                FeedItemSets can only be made for location or
                affiliate location feeds.
            DUPLICATE_NAME (6):
                FeedItemSets duplicate name. Name should be
                unique within an account.
            WRONG_DYNAMIC_FILTER_FOR_FEED_TYPE (7):
                The feed type of the parent Feed is not compatible with the
                type of dynamic filter being set. For example, you can only
                set dynamic_location_set_filter for LOCATION feed item sets.
            DYNAMIC_FILTER_INVALID_CHAIN_IDS (8):
                Chain ID specified for
                AffiliateLocationFeedData is invalid.
