class CampaignExperimentServiceGrpcTransport(

):
    """gRPC backend transport for CampaignExperimentService.

    CampaignExperimentService manages the life cycle of campaign
    experiments. It is used to create new experiments from drafts,
    modify experiment properties, promote changes in an experiment
    back to its base campaign, graduate experiments into new
    stand-alone campaigns, and to remove an experiment.

    An experiment consists of two variants or arms - the base
    campaign and the experiment campaign, directing a fixed share of
    traffic to each arm. A campaign experiment is created from a
    draft of changes to the base campaign and will be a snapshot of
    changes in the draft at the time of creation.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
