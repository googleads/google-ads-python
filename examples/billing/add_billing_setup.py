"""This example creates a billing setup for a customer.

A billing setup is a link between a payments account and a customer. The new
billing setup can either reuse an existing payments account, or create a new
payments account with a given payments profile. Billing setups are applicable
for clients on monthly invoicing only. See here for details about applying for
monthly invoicing: https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375377.
In the case of consolidated billing, a payments account is linked to the
manager account and is linked to a customer account via a billing setup.
