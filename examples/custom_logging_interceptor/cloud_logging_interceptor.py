"""A custom gRPC Interceptor that logs requests and responses to Cloud Logging.

The custom interceptor object is passed into the get_service method of the
GoogleAdsClient. It intercepts requests and responses, parses them into a
human readable structure and logs them using the logging service instantiated
within the class (in this case, a Cloud Logging client).

    This class inherits logic from the LoggingInterceptor, which simplifies the

    underlying logic work -- comments make note of this where applicable.
    NOTE: Inheriting from the LoggingInterceptor class could yield unexpected side
    effects. For example, if the LoggingInterceptor class is updated, this class would
    inherit the updated logic, which could affect its functionality. One option to avoid
