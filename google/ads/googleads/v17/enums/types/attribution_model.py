                Not specified.
            UNKNOWN (1):
                Used for return value only. Represents value

            EXTERNAL (100):
                Uses external attribution.
            GOOGLE_ADS_LAST_CLICK (101):
                Attributes all credit for a conversion to its
                last click.
            GOOGLE_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_CLICK (102):
                Attributes all credit for a conversion to its
                first click using Google Search attribution.
            GOOGLE_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTION_LINEAR (103):
                Attributes credit for a conversion equally

            GOOGLE_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTION_TIME_DECAY (104):
                Attributes exponentially more credit for a
                conversion to its more recent clicks using
                Google Search attribution (half-life is 1 week).
            GOOGLE_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTION_POSITION_BASED (105):
                Attributes 40% of the credit for a conversion
                to its first and last clicks. Remaining 20% is
                evenly distributed across all other clicks. This
                uses Google Search attribution.
            GOOGLE_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTION_DATA_DRIVEN (106):
                Flexible model that uses machine learning to
                determine the appropriate distribution of credit
                among clicks using Google Search attribution.
