                Bookings are for a future date, or a stay is
                underway but the check-out date hasn't passed.
                An active reservation can't be reconciled.
            RECONCILIATION_NEEDED (3):
                Check-out has already taken place, or the
                booked dates have passed without cancellation.
                Bookings that are not reconciled within 45 days
                of the check-out date are billed based on the
                original booking price.
            RECONCILED (4):
                These bookings have been reconciled.
                Reconciled bookings are billed 45 days after the
                check-out date.
            CANCELED (5):
                This booking was marked as canceled. Canceled
                stays with a value greater than zero (due to
                minimum stay rules or cancellation fees) are
                billed 45 days after the check-out date.
