                The received error code is not known in this
                version.

            OPERATION_REQUIRED (5):

                Requested resource not found.

                select any metrics field.
            CANNOT_RETURN_SUMMARY_ROW_FOR_VALIDATE_ONLY_REQUESTS (30):

            INCONSISTENT_RETURN_SUMMARY_ROW_VALUE (31):
                return_summary_row parameter value should be the same
                between requests with page_token field set and their
                original request.
            TOTAL_RESULTS_COUNT_NOT_ORIGINALLY_REQUESTED (32):
                The total results count cannot be returned if
