    Attributes:
        value (float):
            Value of the lifecycle goal. For example, for
            customer acquisition goal, value is the
            incremental conversion value for new customers
            who are not of high value.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_value``.
        high_lifetime_value (float):
            High lifetime value of the lifecycle goal.
            For example, for customer acquisition goal, high
            lifetime value is the incremental conversion
            value for new customers who are of high value.
            High lifetime value should be greater than
            value, if set.
            In current stage, high lifetime value feature is
            in beta and this field is read-only.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_high_lifetime_value``.
